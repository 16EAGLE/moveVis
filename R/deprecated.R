#' Deprecated functions
#'
#' Several functions are deprecated due to a rewrite of moveVis with version 0.10.
#' 
#' @param ... deprecated arguments.
#' 
#' @details The new version of moveVis makes it much easier to animate movement data and multi-temporal imagery (see \code{?moveVis}). You gain more control about the preprocessing of your movement data as well as the visual customization of each animation frame through a more consequent link of \code{moveVis} to \code{gpplot2}.
#'
#' @note To install the old version of moveVis (0.9.9), see \url{https://github.com/16EAGLE/moveVis/releases/tag/v0.9.9}.
