moveVis 0.9.1 BETA (not on CRAN)
- New function animate_raster() for animating just basemaps/for doing the same as with animate_move(), but without movement data
- Added moveStack support: animate_move() now takes also moveStack objects in addition to list objects
- Bug fix: Function now takes movebank.org data --> there had been a static code line preventing the read-out of movement coordinates
- Several major and minor bug fixes
