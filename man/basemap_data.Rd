\description{
This dataset contains two lists of equal lenghts:
\itemize{
   \item a list of ten single-layer \code{raster} objects, representing NDVI images covering the Lake of Constance area.
   \item a list of made-up times that simulate acquisition times with a temporal resolution, remote sensing scientiest would dream of...
}

\details{
This object is used by some \code{moveVis} examples and unit tests.

\note{
All data contained should only be used for testing \code{moveVis} and are not suitable to be used for analysis or interpretation.
