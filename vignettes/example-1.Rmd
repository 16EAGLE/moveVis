First, load the required packages for this example and the `moveVis` example movement data:

```R
library(moveVis)
library(move)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)

data("move_data")
```

`move_data` is a `moveStack`, containing three individual tracks. `moveVis` works with `move` class objects. If your movement tracks are present as `data.frames`, see <a href="http://movevis.org/reference/df2move.html">`df2move()`</a> and the example code there for conversion. Let's have a look at both timestamps and sampling rates of `move_data`:

```R
unique(timestamps(move_data))
timeLag(move_data, unit = "mins")
```

We can conclude that each track has a sampling rate of roughly 4 minutes, however sampling rates differ over time. Due to this, tracks do not share unique timestamps. For animation, unique frame times are needed, regardless if we want to animate a single track or multiple at once. Thus, we need to align `move_data` in order to
* make all tracks share unique timestamps that can be assigned to frames
* make all tracks share unique, steady sampling rates without gaps

You can use  <a href="http://movevis.org/reference/align_move.html">`align_move()`</a> to align `move_data` to a sampling rate of 4 minutes (240 seconds) at the seconds digit ":00":

```R
move_data <- align_move(move_data, res = 240, digit = 0, unit = "secs")
```

Instead, you could apply your own functions for aligning your data, e.g. using more advanced interpolation methods.

Now, as the movement tracks are aligned, we can pair them with a base map to create frames that can be turned into an animation later on. You can use your own custom base map imagery or choose from default map types. Here is a GIF of some example base maps you can use out of the box thanks to the <a href = "http://github.com/MilesMcBain/slippymath">`slippymath`</a> package:

You can display a list of all available maps:

```R
# get a list of all available map_services and map_types
get_maptypes()`

$osm
 [1] "streets"      "streets_de"   "streets_fr"   "humanitarian" "topographic"  "roads"       
 [7] "hydda"        "hydda_base"   "hike"         "grayscale"    "no_labels"    "watercolor"  
[13] "toner"        "toner_bg"     "toner_lite"   "terrain"      "terrain_bg"   "mtb"         

$carto
 [1] "light"                "light_no_labels"      "light_only_labels"    "dark"                
 [5] "dark_no_labels"       "dark_only_labels"     "voyager"              "voyager_no_labels"   
 [9] "voyager_only_labels"  "voyager_labels_under"

$mapbox
 [1] "satellite"     "streets"       "streets_basic" "hybrid"        "light"        
 [6] "dark"          "high_contrast" "outdoors"      "hike"          "wheatpaste"   
[11] "pencil"        "comic"         "pirates"       "emerald"      


```

Currently, you can use more than 40 types of maps, provided by `OpenStreetMap`, `Carto` (both free without registration) and `Mapbox` (free, but registration required). Most maps display thematic or terrain data, while `Mapbox` also offers satellite imagery (see <a href="http://movevis.org/articles/example-3.html">Example 3: using a mapbox satellite base map</a> for details on how to register and use mapbox).

In this example, we want to use the OpenStreetMap 'watercolour' imagery with a transparency of 50% to start with something nice looking and colourful. To create a list of spatial frames from `move_data` using a map, we can use `frames_spatial()`:

```R
frames <- frames_spatial(move_data, path_colours = c("red", "green", "blue"),
                         map_service = "osm", map_type = "watercolor", alpha = 0.5)
```

Instead of using `path_colours`, you can add a `colour` column to your `move` or `moveStack` object. This allows you to colour your movement tracks as you want, e.g. not only by individual track, but by behavioral segment, time, age, speed or something different (see <a href = "http://movevis.org/reference/frames_spatial.html">`?frames_spatial`</a> for details).

Have a look at the newly created `frames` list object and display a randomly selected frame to get a first impression, how your animation will look like:

```R
length(frames) # number of frames
frames[[100]] # display one of the frames
```

<p align="center"><img width="700" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/16EAGLE/AUX_data/master/data/moveVis_readme/readme_example1_01.png"></p>

You can pass any list of frames like the one we just created to `animate_frames()`. This function will turn your frames into an animation, written as a GIF image or a video file. For now, we du not want to add any customizations to `frames` and just create a `GIF` from it. If you are not sure, which output formats can be used, run `suggest_formats()` that returns you a vector of file suffixes that can be created on your system. For making a `GIF` from `frames`, just run:

```R
animate_frames(frames, out_file = "/full/path/to/example_1.gif")
```
